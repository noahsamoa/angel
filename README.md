# Ophanim Animation

This repository contains code for creating a visually stunning representation of a biblically accurate angel using Three.js. The angel is composed of various elements, including rings, eyes, and text, each with different materials and animations.

## Features

- **Interactive Animation**: The angel's wings and rings rotate, and the eye wobbles up and down.
- **Custom Text Rendering**: Monospace text is rendered behind the angel, allowing for customization.

## Usage

To view the angel animation, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports WebGL.

## Credits

- **Three.js**: The animation is built using the Three.js library, which provides a powerful framework for creating 3D content in the browser.
- **Textures**: The flame effect texture is sourced from the Three.js examples library.
-  **[ASCII Art Converter](https://ascii-generator.site/)**: This was used to create the ASCII image of the wings in the background.
